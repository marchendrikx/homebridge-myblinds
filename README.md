This plugin is used to test the installation of a Homebrigde plugin
in order to develop an own blinds control application on Raspberry PI.
This application will make use of a Homebridge plugin to connect to 
an iPhone that will enable the user to open or close blinds on distance.
The Raspberry PI will interface over RS232 with an ABB-EIB system.
Next to the blinds control by the plugin, a timer program will control
switching the blinds following user defined time programs per blind.
The time parameters for this user defined time program can be set 
via iPhone, iPad or Windows10 PC system.
